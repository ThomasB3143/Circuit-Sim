# Electrical Circuit Simulator for A-Level Physics
My NEA for A-level computer science, a Java app that allows the user to construct a circuit, modify component values, to recieve the current and voltage across each component.  
The "development-documentation.pdf" contains the written portion of the NEA, highlighting the features and development of the modified nodal analysis algorithm, the OOP model used to represent parts of a circuit, designing the user interface, reflecting on feedback and more!  
Simply run "Main.java" to start up the program!
